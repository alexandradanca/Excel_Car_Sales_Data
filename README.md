  <h1>Data Vizualization and Dashboard in Excel and Power BI</h1>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>I'm hired by <i>SwiftAuto Traders</i>, a chain of car dealerships, as a Data Scientist. My first task is to analyze car sales and profits for each dealer. I need to create some visualizations and present them as a dashboard/report to my regional manager for better understanding on car sales and profits for each dealer.</p>
<p>The dataset used comes from: <a href="https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00142&id=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&objRef=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22reportView%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22DAT00142%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D">link to dataset</a></p>

<h2>Create Visualizations using Excel</h2>

<p>The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in car sales for SwiftAuto Traders. The goal is to provide insights on car sales and profits for each dealer.</p>

<h3>Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:</h3>
<h4>1. Quantity Sold by Dealer ID</h4>
<p>
Insert a pivot table using the ‘Dealer ID’ and ‘Quantity Sold’ columns.
Create a bar chart based on the pivot table.
Sort the chart in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold.
Change the chart title to “Quantity Sold by Dealer ID.”

<ol>
     <li>In the first compact rectangle, showcase Profit formatted to one decimal place, represented in millions of US dollars.</li>
     <li>In the second compact rectangle, exhibit the Quantity sold.</li>
     <li>In the third compact rectangle, feature the Average quantity sold.</li>
     <li>In the first expansive rectangle, present Quantity sold by model in the form of a bar chart.</li>
     <li> In the second expansive rectangle on the Sales dashboard, illustrate Profit by Dealer ID using a column chart, sorted in ascending order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within the Service dashboard, represent the following key performance indicators (KPIs) through visualizations:</p>

<ol>
     <li>In the upper-left section, visualize the number of recalls per car model using a column chart.</li>
     <li>In the lower-left section, depict customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews through a treemap.</li>
     <li>In the upper-right section, display the quantity of cars sold per month alongside the corresponding profit, utilizing a combination of line and column charts.</li>
     <li>In the lower-right section, exhibit the number of recalls categorized by car model and affected system in the form of a heat map. This visualization will provide insights into potential outliers for a specific model or system.</li>
</ol>
